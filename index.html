        <h1>Regex Tutorial</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Regex Tutorial! Regular expressions, often referred to as "regex," are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing. In this tutorial, we will explore the world of regex and its components. Regular expressions are essential for tasks like data validation, search and replace operations, and text parsing. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced developer seeking to refine your skills, this tutorial will guide you through the fundamental elements of regex. By the end, you'll be equipped to harness the full potential of regular expressions in your programming projects.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In this tutorial, we will focus on a common regex pattern for validating email addresses. The regex pattern for email validation can be summarized as follows: ^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$ This pattern checks whether a given string is a valid email address. It begins and ends with the ^ and $ anchors, ensuring that the entire string is matched. The regex consists of three main components: the local part (before the "@" symbol), the domain part (between the "@" and the last "."), and the top-level domain (e.g., ".com"). We'll break down each component to understand how this regex pattern works.

    <main>
        <section id="anchors">
            <h2>Anchors</h2>
            Anchors define the start (^) and end ($) of the regex pattern. They ensure that the pattern matches the entire string and doesn't allow partial matches.
        </section>

        <section id="quantifiers">
            <h2>Quantifiers</h2>
            In the provided email regex, quantifiers are not explicitly used, but they could be used to specify the number of characters in the local and domain parts. For example, * means zero or more, and + means one or more characters.
        </section>

        <section id="grouping constructs">
            <h2>Grouping Constructs</h2>
            Grouping constructs, denoted by parentheses, are used to group subpatterns together. In the email regex, you can group the local part and the domain part for better readability and potential future modifications.
        </section>

        <section id="bracket expressions">
            <h2>Bracket Expressions</h2>
            Bracket expressions, like [\w\.-], are used to specify character ranges. In this regex, [\w\.-] matches word characters, dots, and hyphens.
        </section>
        
        <section id="character classes">
            <h2>Character Classes</h2>
            Character classes, like \w, match specific types of characters. \w matches word characters (letters, digits, or underscores).
        </section>

        <section id="the or operator">
            <h2>The OR Operator</h2>
            The OR operator, denoted by |, allows you to specify alternatives. For example, you could use it to match different top-level domains (e.g., ".com" or ".net").
